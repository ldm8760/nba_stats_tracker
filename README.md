NBA Stats tracker / assistant

What makes a current team good:

Net rating = Offensive rating - defensive rating

NBA statistical analysis

Game utility stat:

PTC + REB + AST + STL

Where PTC = |PTS|
PTC = (FGM - FG3M) x 2 + FG3M x 3 + FTM

Giving us the Game utility function

G(X)

Where X = {Games}

This has to be adjusted, does not consider each game

G(X) can be compared to:
Blocks
Points?
Turnovers
Minutes
